# HuntTheWumpus
my attempt at the classic text based game, by gregory yob! 

i'll begin by outling the rules of the game; which are simple.
In a cave of 20 rooms, a monster called the Wumpus is hiding. You must shoot the Wumpus with a special arrow that kills him. Note, running into the Wumpus' room will startle him, and have him eat you. Likewise, shooting into a room will startle the Wumpus, no matter where on the map he is. 

You must also avoid the Wumpus' two pet giant bats, that if you run into, will randomly drop you into a room anywhere on the map. The Wumpus is also doing some home renovating, and thus there are also two pits to the abyss that will most certainly kill you, if you run into.

You can only move into rooms that are adjacent to you, and can NOT move diagonally. i.e your only directions are left,right, up and down. You have only 5 of these limited magic arrows, and when you run out - your quest is failed and the game is over.

This was my first non trivial project, Written on June 15th 2021. The chances are if you're reading this, you're more than likely a prospective employer to which I've left you this commentary in an attempt to make myself look better.

My first thoughts after finishing the game were how messy my code was. I tried to keep things simple, and only use concepts and functions that I was taught. The learning material used was Bjarne Stroustrups _programming prinicples and practices using c++_ which you will have seen linked in my resume. This project is actually an excersise from the book's chapter 18 problems, so i've thus only used concepts taught up till then, and anything in the appendix.

My second thoughts were
